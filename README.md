## Weather App

#### Basic workflow:
- Weather data would be fetched from an API.
- Location of user would be accessed by using the permissions in Android or IOS.

#### The app is divided into three fragments:
1. Home : Displays weather information of current location of user over a week.
1. Add Locations : Where user can search and add locations and get to know that place's weather data.
1. Settings : User can change certain features like temperature unit, wind unit, air pressure unit etc. One can even shift to dark mode by changing the settings!
